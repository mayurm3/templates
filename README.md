# Templates

This files tries to convey the purpose of this repository.

Short Term: (This Repo - Templates)
* Basic Code: Getting started with language syntax (Python, C, Scala, Java). Something we can come back to for syntactical hurdles to refresh when we jump across using multiple languages
* Basic Framework: Getting started with language frameworks (Python, C, Scala, Java)
* Basic Cloud: This is next step where we pick SDK from cloud native to work upon more frameworks/tools for complex problems (ex. MoM, Mail, Docker, K8s etc.)

Long Term: (Next Repo)
* Documentation: This is to draft a Product Vision in selective domains and then link it back to use of above repos as starting points and use these new repositories as feedback to use/improve the above basis problems being tackled in the Product. This is particularly to get deep into a business context to understand problems and build solutions for the same.

In any of the above purpose you would notice each of the repo/product doesn't serve any business purpose or outcome. The Long Term (Next Repo) would seprately define the purpose of respective product and build the necessary solutions in selected domains.

One Step at a time.
